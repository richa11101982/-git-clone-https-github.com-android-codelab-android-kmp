You may need to introduce techniques like **learning rate annealing** or **Adaptive Loss Weighting** to ensure the $\\mathcal{L}_{Physics}$ term doesn't dominate or become negligibly small early in training.\n",
        "2.  **Architecture:** The choice of hidden layers, neurons, and activation function (`Tanh` is good for PINNs) is crucial.\n",
